## E-COMMERCE PRODUCT PAGE

### :shell: PROJECT IN A NUTSHELL

It is one of the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges, which help to improve the coding skills by building realistic projects.
This challenge was to build out an e-commerce product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### :unlock: FEATURES 

Users should be able to:

* View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
* See hover states for interactive elements on the page
* Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
* Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
* Add items to the cart
* View the cart and remove items from it

###  SOLUTIONS APPLIED IN THE PROJECT

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS custom properties
* SASS
* Flexbox
* Grid
* Mobile-first workflow
* BEM patterns
* React

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge, so decided to go for React as I want to practice it more.

I refreshed my knowledge in React Hooks (UseState & UseContext). Especially UseContext was very helpful within this project.

Initially I wanted to use Redux but after watching this ![video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poQXNp9ItL4&t=5093s), I decided that for this project it does it make sense.
It is a small app, with quite simple UI and static data, so there is no point for overengineering. I will build another app, where I can focus on Redux.
Or make this one bigger as a separate project, with more products.

###  SOLUTIONS I STILL WANT TO ADD 

* adding more products to the store and using Redux 
* adding some custom Hooks
